This website is designed to help you with your first pull request on GitHub ðŸŽ‰

The website uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) [gem](https://rubygems.org/), to convert
[Markdown files](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) to html. Click
on any of the links if you want to learn more about Jekyll, ruby gems and
Markdown files! ðŸ˜ƒ

The files used to make this website are available on the repository
[getting-started-with-open-source](https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/getting-started-with-open-source).
Each time you make a change to the repository the website automatically changes!
